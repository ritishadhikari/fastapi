sqlite3 .\todos.db: Open sqlit in terminal with the name of the db

Various modes in sqlite are:
.mode=columns, box, tables, markdown

JSON Web Token:
    - A JSON Web Token is created of three separate parts separated by dots (.), which
    includes:
        - Header : (a)
            - consists of two parts:
                - The algorithm (alg) for signing
                - The specific type (typ) of 
            - ex:
                ```
                    {
                        "alg":"HS256",
                        "type":"JWT"
                    }
                ```
        - Payload : (b)
            - It consists of the data. 
            - The payloads data contains claims, and there are three different types
            of claims
                - Registered
                - Public
                - Private
            - The JWT payload is then encoded using Base64 to create the second part
            of the JWT(b)
            - ex:
                ```
                    {
                        "sub":"12345678",
                        "name":"Eric Roby",
                        "given_name":"Eric",
                        "family_name":"Roby",
                        "email":"codingwithRoby@gmail.com",
                        "admin": true
                    }
                ```
        - Signature : (c)
            - A JWT signature is created by using the algorithm in the header to hash
            out the encoded header, encoded payload with a secret
            - The secret can be anything, but is saved somewhere on the server that
            the client does not have access to
            - ex:
            ```
                HMACSHA256(
                    base64UrlEncode(header) + "." +
                    base64UrlEncode(payload),
                    learnonline
                )
            ```
        - ex. aaaaaaaa.bbbbbbbbb.ccccccccc
    - A JWT header consists of
