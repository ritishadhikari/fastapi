If there are dynamic parameters, it is a best practice to keep it
after the standard function definition
```
# earlier
@app.get("books/my_book"):
def read_all_books(my_book):
    return {"book":"my_book"}

# later
@app.get("books/{dynamic_book_name}"):
def read_all_books(dynamic_book_name):
    return {"dynamic_book":dynamic_book_name}
```
